In AWS, they have organizations which let you create <code>Organizational Units (OUs)</code> which you can create based on the environment (eg, Security OU), and under that OU you can create a specific account for distinct functions (eg, Log Archive account, Security Tooling account, Network account, etc.)</p> <p>In Azure, there are Management Groups and Subscriptions. You can create Production, Non-Production, etc., and at the Subscription level, you can isolate by development/test environments.</p> </li> <li> <p>Identity and access management, long are the days when attackers are exploiting vulnerabilities, but scanning the internet for leaked access keys and credentials. Having a single source of truth can help improve your security. I'm biased, so I would say Entra ID should be your IdP, and federate AWS to it. For Entra ID, you can implement Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to utilize Just-In-Time access to highly permissioned roles that require approval. AWS has the IAM Identity Center, which prohibits the use of access keys and instead provides temporary credentials via roles.</p> </li> <li> <p>Network security and isolation. You want to segment your network with VNets (Azure) and VPCs (AWS), then implement private endpoints. You don't want your database to accept requests from the internet. Firewalls are also a magnificent security tool to implement, which inspects traffic entering and leaving your environment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data protection: at rest, in transit, and in use. Use Customer-Managed Keys (CMKs) in AWS KMS and Azure Key Vault. This gives your company control over key rotation and revocation. Please never hard-code secrets... it wouldn't be a secret if you did. AWS Secrets Manager and Azure Key Vault exist to programmatically retrieve and rotate database credentials, API keys, and much more. You also need to know what data your company has and where it is. May I suggest Microsoft Purview...</p> </li> <li> <p>All of this sounds good, but without the proper governance, you will not get far, lol. Managing the complexity of a multi-cloud environment, centralized visibility, and automated compliance are required.

These modules cover various protocols and services, including TCP, UDP, SMB, and more.</li> <li>Database: A centralized database for storing and managing information about your targets, services, vulnerabilities, and scan results. This facilitates efficient organization and tracking of penetration testing activities, especially in larger engagements.</li> <li>Exploit Modules: A vast collection of exploit modules that target known vulnerabilities in various operating systems, applications, and devices.

Increasing this value can speed up scans but may also increase the likelihood of detection.</li> <li><code>PORTS</code>: Specifies the port range to scan. Unlike Nmap's default behavior, Metasploit scans the specified port numbers directly.</li> <li><code>RHOSTS</code>: Defines the target host(s) or network range. Can be a single IP, a range, or a CIDR block.</li> <li><code>THREADS</code>: Sets the number of concurrent threads used for scanning. Higher thread counts generally result in faster scans.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Nmap Integration: Metasploit allows you to execute Nmap scans directly from the <code>msfconsole</code> using the <code>nmap</code> command, providing a familiar interface for those accustomed to Nmap.</li> <li>UDP Scanning: The <code>auxiliary/scanner/discovery/udp_sweep</code> module scans for common UDP services like DNS, NTP, and NetBIOS. UDP scans can be slower and less reliable than TCP scans due to the lack of connection establishment.</li> <li>SMB Scanning: Metasploit provides modules for enumerating SMB shares (<code>smb_enumshares</code>) and identifying SMB versions (<code>smb_version</code>). These are particularly useful in corporate environments where SMB is prevalent.</li> <li>NetBIOS Scanning: NetBIOS scans can reveal valuable information about systems on a network, including their roles (e.g., file server, domain controller) and potentially shared resources.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"information_technology/cybersecurity/red_team/tryhackme/Junior%20Penetration%20Tester/Metasploit/Metasploit_Exploitation/#iii-metasploit-database","title":"III.

The \"open|filtered\" result means Nmap can't definitively say if the port is open or blocked by a firewall.</p> </li> <li> <p>FIN Scan (-sF): Sends a packet with only the FIN (finish) flag set. Similar to the Null scan, it's stealthy but vulnerable to stateful firewalls. The interpretation of responses is the same as the Null scan.</p> </li> <li> <p>Xmas Scan (-sX): Sets the FIN, PSH (push), and URG (urgent) flags \u2013 hence the name, like Christmas lights. It's also stealthy and has the same response interpretation as Null and FIN scans. Less reliable on Windows hosts.</p> </li> <li> <p>Maimon Scan (-sM): Sets the FIN and ACK flags. Historically, some BSD-derived systems would respond differently to this scan on open ports, but this is rare today. Most modern systems treat it like a Null/FIN/Xmas scan.</p> </li> <li> <p>ACK Scan (-sA): Sends a packet with only the ACK flag set. Crucially, all ports, whether open or closed, should respond with an RST. This scan is not used to directly find open ports. Instead, it's used to map firewall rules. If a firewall doesn't block the ACK packet, the port is marked \"unfiltered,\" suggesting the firewall isn't blocking that traffic. This helps identify which ports a firewall is not filtering, but it doesn't mean a service is running on those ports.</p> </li> <li> <p>Window Scan (-sW): Similar to the ACK scan, it sends an ACK packet. However, it analyzes the TCP Window field in the RST responses. Some systems provide different window sizes for open and closed ports, allowing for differentiation. Like the ACK scan, it's more useful for firewall mapping than direct port discovery.</p> </li> <li> <p>Custom Scan (--scanflags): Allows you to craft a TCP packet with any combination of flags.

It uses JSON (JWTs) via REST APIs. It is built for the modern internet where \"The App\" might be on a phone, a watch, or a smart TV. It is friendly to developers and mobile devices because JSON is native to the web (Javascript).

Analyzing the Problem: This is the first step where the problem is read and understood. It involves identifying the inputs, outputs, and the relationship between them. It\u2019s crucial to have a clear understanding of what is being asked before moving on to the next steps.</p> <p>2. Developing an Algorithm or Pseudocode: Once the problem is understood, the next step is to develop an algorithm or pseudocode. An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem, and pseudocode is a way of expressing this algorithm in a simplified manner, that doesn\u2019t adhere to the syntax of any specific programming language. This step helps in logically organizing thoughts and provides a roadmap for the actual coding process.</p> <p>3. Writing Code: After the algorithm or pseudocode is ready, the next step is to translate it into actual Python code. This involves knowing the syntax and semantics of Python, and how to use them to implement the logic defined in the previous step. It\u2019s important to write clean and efficient code that not only solves the problem but is also easy to understand and maintain.</p> <p>4. Testing and Debugging: The final step is to test the code with various inputs to ensure it works as expected. This involves both positive and negative testing. If the code doesn\u2019t work as expected, debugging is done to identify and fix the issues. Debugging is the process of finding and resolving defects or problems within a computer program that prevent correct operation of the software.</p> <p>This four-step process is iterative and often requires going back and forth between the steps. For example, while testing, one might find that the code doesn\u2019t handle a certain edge case. This would require going back to the algorithm development step to update the logic, and then updating the code accordingly. This process continues until the code works correctly for all expected inputs and edge cases. It\u2019s a systematic approach that ensures the problem is fully understood and the solution is thoroughly tested.</p> <p>Example: Automating the process of pinging a list of network devices and checking their availability.</p> <p>Step 1. Analyzing the Problem: The task is to automate the process of pinging a list of network devices and checking their availability. The input is a list of IP addresses, and the output is the status of each device (available or not available).</p> <p>Step 2. Developing an Algorithm or Pseudocode: Here\u2019s a simple algorithm for the problem:</p> <pre><code>For each IP address in the list:\n    Use the ping command to ping the IP address\n    If the ping command returns a success:\n        Mark the device as available\n    Else:\n        Mark the device as not available\nEnd For\n</code></pre> <p>Step 3. Writing Code: Here\u2019s a Python code snippet that implements the above algorithm using the os module:</p> <pre><code>import os\ndef ping_devices(ip_addresses):\n    device_status = {}\n\n    for ip in ip_addresses:\n        response = os.system(\"ping -c 1 \" + ip)\n        if response == 0:\n            device_status[ip] = 'Available'\n        else:\n            device_status[ip] = 'Not Available'\n\n    return device_status\n</code></pre> <p>Step 4. Testing and Debugging: Testing can be done by providing a list of known IP addresses to the function and checking if the output matches the expected results. Debugging involves identifying any errors in the code, understanding why they\u2019re happening, and then making the necessary corrections.</p> <pre><code>ip_addresses = ['192.168.1.1', '192.168.1.2', '192.168.1.3']\nprint(ping_devices(ip_addresses))\n</code></pre> <p>This will print the status of each device in the list. If there are any errors or unexpected outputs, the code should be debugged accordingly. For example, if an IP address is incorrectly marked as \u2018Not Available\u2019, it might be worth checking if the ping command is working as expected, or if there\u2019s a problem with the network connection.</p> <p>Remember, this is a simple example and real-world network automation tasks can be much more complex. But the four-step process remains the same: analyze the problem, develop an algorithm, write the code, and then test and debug. This systematic approach can help tackle even the most complex problems.</p>","tags":["Python"]},{"location":"security_automation/python/questions_i_asked_myself/","title":"Questions I Ask Myself","text":""},{"location":"security_automation/python/questions_i_asked_myself/#what-is-the-difference-between-functions-methods-and-modules","title":"What is the difference between functions, methods, and modules?","text":"<p>Functions are blocks of code which is designed to do one job or have one responsibility.
