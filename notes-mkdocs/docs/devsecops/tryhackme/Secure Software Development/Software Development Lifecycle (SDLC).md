### What is the SDLC?

- A structured methodology that outlines the steps involved in developing software.
- Provides guidance for creating a software application, from initial planning to maintenance.
### SDLC Phases:

1. **Planning (Feasibility Stage):**
    
    - Encompasses project and product management aspects.
    - Resource allocation, project scheduling, cost estimation.
    - _Key Question:_ Is this project feasible?
2. **Requirements Definition:**
    
    - Determines what the application should do and its requirements.
    - _Example:_ A social media app needs friend connection functionality.
    - _Focus:_ Defining the initial prototype idea.
3. **Design & Prototyping:**
    
    - Establishes _how_ the application will work.
    - Programming language, communication methods, architecture.
    - Outlining user interfaces and network requirements.
    - _Key Deliverable:_ Architecture Design Review (ARD) document, created by engineers and developers to ensure alignment across teams.
4. **Software Development:**
    
    - Building the program, writing code, and creating documentation.
5. **Testing:**
    
    - Ensuring components work individually and together.
    - Functionality testing, integration testing, performance testing.
    - _Goal:_ Identify and fix bugs and performance issues.
6. **Deployment:**
    
    - Making the application available to users.
7. **Operations & Maintenance:**
    
    - Responding to issues and bugs reported by users.
    - Planning future features and releases.
    - Ongoing support and updates.
### DevOps Metrics and Frameworks:

- **[CALMS Framework](https://www.atlassian.com/devops/frameworks/calms-framework):** Assesses a company's ability to adopt DevOps processes. Culture, Automation, Lean, Measurement, Sharing.
- **Key Metrics:**
    - **MTTP (Mean Time to Production):** Time between code commit and deployment. _How long does it take for a code change to reach production?_
    - **Deployment Frequency:** How often are releases deployed?
    - **Average Lead Time:** Time to develop, build, test, and deploy a new feature.
    - **Deployment Speed:** Time to deploy a new release into production.
    - **Deployment Agility:** Combined measure of deployment speed and frequency.
    - **Production Failure Rate:** How often do failures occur in production?
    - **MTTR (Mean Time to Recover):** Time to recover after a failure. _How quickly can we restore service after an outage?_
### SDLC Models:

- Waterfall, Agile, etc., are examples of different SDLC _models_ or methodologies. They provide different approaches to managing the phases of the SDLC.
