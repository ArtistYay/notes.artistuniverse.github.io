### The Problem with Waterfall & Rise of Agile

- **Waterfall Model:**
    - Sequential phases, rigid structure.
    - Difficult collaboration, blame game when issues arose.
    - Slow feedback cycles.
- **Agile Methodology:**
    - Emphasizes team collaboration over contracts.
    - Self-organizing teams, constructive collaboration.
    - Iterative development, faster feedback.
    - _Key Difference:_ Focus on teamwork and flexibility.
### DevOps: The Cultural Shift

- **Beyond Methodologies:** DevOps isn't just a process, it's a _cultural change_.
- **Goal:** Increase efficiency through trust and better communication between developers and other teams (Ops, Security, etc.).
- **Key Enablers:** Automation and integration are crucial for driving this cultural change and uniting teams. This helps break down silos.
### The Infinite Loop (DevOps Lifecycle)

- **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery/Deployment):**
    - Frequent code merging.
    - Automated testing for new code pushes and merges.
    - _Goal:_ Quickly and reliably release changes.
- **IaC (Infrastructure as Code):**
    - Provisioning infrastructure through reusable, consistent code.
    - _Benefit:_ Automation, consistency, version control for infrastructure.
- **Orchestration:**
    - Automating complex workflows.
    - _Example:_ Container orchestration (Kubernetes).
- **Monitoring:**
    - Collecting data to analyze performance and stability of services.
    - _Goal:_ Proactive identification and resolution of issues.
- **Microservices:**
    - Breaking down applications into small, independent services.
    - _Benefit:_ Easier to develop, deploy, and scale individual parts of an application.
### Shifting Left

- **Definition:** Integrating security practices early in the software development lifecycle.
- _Why?_ Reduces the cost and effort of fixing security vulnerabilities later. Makes security a part of the process, not an afterthought.
### DevSecOps: Security Strikes Back

- **Core Idea:** Builds on DevOps by integrating security as a _shared responsibility_. Everyone on the team is responsible for security, not just a dedicated security engineer.
- **Key Principles:**
    - Automation: Automate security testing and processes.
    - Platform Design: Design platforms with security built-in.
    - Shared Responsibility: Breaks down security silos.
- **Challenges of Traditional Security (Silos):**
    - Siloed Culture: Security team isolated, leading to communication and collaboration issues.
    - Lack of Visibility: Difficult to prioritize and address the right risks at the right time.
    - Stringent Processes: Overly complicated security procedures that slow down development. This can lead to developers bypassing security altogether.
