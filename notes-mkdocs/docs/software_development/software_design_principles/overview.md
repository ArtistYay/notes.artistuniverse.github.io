# Software Design Principles

## What are Software Design Principles?

Coding standards are rules or guidelines that developers follow to ensure their code is as clean as possible. Software design is the process of defining a system’s architecture before implementing it in code.

You can’t build something without a blueprint, so it’s nice to plan out the structure and behavior of the system.
