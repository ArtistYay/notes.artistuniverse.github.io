	When things fall apart and we're on the verge of we know not what, the test of each of us is to stay on that brink and not concretize. The spiritual journey is not about heaven and finally getting to a place that's really swell.

_What is the author trying to explain or prove?_

How I interpret this is that when things fall apart, we try to revert to our old ways to find a solution, but instead, we need to discard that version of ourselves for the present one.

_Why does it matter in the bigger story?_

There is a reason why we need to move forward; sometimes our old selves no longer serve our bigger purposes. 
### Notes
- Sometimes we carry an image of who we are, which is just an illusion of reality.
- Being exposed to hard truths about oneself can help build you into who you need to be.
- When we face the truth about ourselves, we often begin to self-destruct. That is the time to be kind to oneself.
- This is a phase in the spiritual journey one must undergo: losing the truth and finding love within oneself.
- The test behind failing or when things go wrong is not overcoming it, but rather making room for it and feeling it.
- Ultimately, leaving room to feel it without thinking of the bad or the good is important.
- A spiritual journey is not about arriving at heaven; this thought process keeps us miserable.
- Suffering is inevitable; what you do during that suffering is what matters.
- Sticking with that uncertainty, learning to relax in the midst of chaos, and not panicking is the spiritual path.
- Catch yourself when things fall apart.
