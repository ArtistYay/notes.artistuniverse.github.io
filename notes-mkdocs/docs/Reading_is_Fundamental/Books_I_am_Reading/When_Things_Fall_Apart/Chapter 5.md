_What is the author trying to explain or prove?_

Learning to control your emotions will create an open space for self-kindness.

_Why does it matter in the bigger story?_

Emotions can make hasty decisions, learning to process them and what got them to come up can help with understanding what's in front of you.
### Notes
- Humans can label themselves as the worst, especially when things get bad.
- You can not find contentment without having kindness or love for oneself.
- Let go of control and unlearn outdated concepts and ideals.
- Sitting in stillness, your mind races, but do not beat yourself up; meet yourself with compassion.
- If all this is a dream, spend it trying to look at what scares you instead of running away.
- Find joy in life.
