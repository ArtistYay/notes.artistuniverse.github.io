	We can meet out match with a poodle or with a raging guard dog, but the interesting question is, what happens next?

_What is the author trying to explain or prove?_

When we reach our limits, we freeze instead of moving forward; we lean forward into discomfort and see it clearly, rather than protecting ourselves.

_Why does it matter in the bigger story?_

This matters because I have personally found that my emotions have kept me stagnant instead of facing them. Granted, I did not know how to cope with some emotions, I sought help, and now I place confidence in myself to face whatever is happening in the present moment.
### Notes
- Discomfort or uncomfortable moments and feelings reveal true clarity within oneself. They teach us to lean in more, rather than giving up.
- We ease the pain with distractions.
- Mediation is about facing our fears, letting them go, and opening our hearts to new possibilities.
- Every end is a beginning, and every death is a birth.
- Anxiety is a feeling that we are doing something new. It is not a bad thing, being able to identify the cause instead of freaking out is healthy.
- Sooner or later, it will happen, but what happens next?
- Acknowledge whatever arises without judgment, letting the thoughts dissolve, and then going back to the openness of the very moment.
