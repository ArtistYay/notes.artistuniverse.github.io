	Fear is a natural reaction to moving closer to the truth.

_What is the author trying to explain or prove?_

When exploring new things, sometimes it is not what it seems, and that is when fear shows up, but instead of running from it, embrace it.

_Why does it matter in the bigger story?_

Intimacy with fear gives the courage to be in the present moment. The fear of the unknown trips us up, makes us uncomfortable, but truth comes with fear.

### Notes

- When starting the spiritual journey, you will not know what to expect. Sometimes it is smooth, and sometimes you will fall.
- Buddhism has many teachings that can inspire us to embark on a spiritual journey, but upon closer examination, we will inevitably encounter fear.
- Everything feels fear; it is universal. It is part of being alive.
- When faced with fear, things become clearer.
- It is not possible to be in the present and future at the same time. When a person is in the present, things become clearer, and fear comes into play.
- People start the exploration thinking it will give them the answers they are looking for, but it does not. Mediation is not a cure.
- You have to move closer to fear. Accept it and agree with it, not try to make it better, but really confront it.
- As humans, we automatically run from fear. Being aware of that is good. When we run from fear, we cheat ourselves out of the present moment.
