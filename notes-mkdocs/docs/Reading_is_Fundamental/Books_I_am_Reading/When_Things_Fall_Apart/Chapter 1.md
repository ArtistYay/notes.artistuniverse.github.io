_What is the author trying to explain or prove?_

When exploring new things, sometimes it is not what it seems, and that is when fear shows up, but instead of running from it, embrace it.

_Why does it matter in the bigger story?_

Intimacy with fear gives the courage to be in the present moment. The fear of the unknown trips us up, makes us uncomfortable, but truth comes with fear.

## Notes

- When starting the spiritual journey, you will not know what to expect. Sometimes it is smooth, and sometimes you will fall.
- Buddhism has many teachings that can inspire us to embark on a spiritual journey, but upon closer examination, we will inevitably encounter fear.
- Everything feels fear; it is universal. It is part of being alive.
- When faced with fear, things become clearer.
- It is not possible to be in the present and future at the same time. When a person is in the present, things become clearer, and fear comes into play.
- People start the exploration thinking it will give them the answers they are looking for, but it does not. Mediation is not a cure.
- You have to move closer to fear. Accept it and agree with it, not try to make it better, but really confront it.
- As humans, we automatically run from fear. Being aware of that is good. When we run from fear, we cheat ourselves out of the present moment.

## Words I learned while reading

1. **Dathun** - a month-long Shambhala Buddhist meditation retreat.
    1. **The sentence I saw it in**: "Unlike the dathun talks that make up _Wisdom of No Escape_..."
    2. **One new sentence I wrote using it**: Sometime in the future, I would be interested to undergo a dathun.
2. **Pedantic** - dull, unimaginative
    1. **The sentence I saw it in**: "Now and then, I would look at a few transcripts. I found them everything from pedantic to delightful."
    2. **One new sentence I wrote using it**: In high school algebra, it was pedantic to me.
3. **Profusion** - great quantity: lavish display or supply
    1. **The sentence I saw it in**: "It was both interesting and embarrassing to be faced with such a profusion of my own words."
    2. **One new sentence I wrote using it**: Having a profusion in one's life can create happiness and gratitude.
4. Mairi - loving kindness toward oneself
    1. **The sentence I saw it in**: "Gradually, as I read more, I began to see that in some way, no matter what subject I had chosen, what country I was in, or what year it was, I had taught endlessly about the same things: the great need for maitri, and developing from that the awakening of a fearlessly compassionate attitude toward our own painand that of others."
    2. **One new sentence I wrote using it**: Finding mairi for myself is the ultimate goal currently.
5. **Dualistic** - a view of human beings as constituted of two irreducible elements (such as matter and spirit).
    1. **The sentence I saw it in**: "The underlying theme was dissolving the dualistic tension between us and them, this and that, good and bad, by inviting in what we usually avoid.
    2. **One new sentence I wrote using it**:
6. **Gusty** - a sudden outburst
    1. **The sentence I saw it in**: "It occurred to me that for all those seven years, I'd been simply trying to digest and communicate the helpful and very gutsy instructions that Trungpa Rinpoche gave his students."
    2. **One new sentence I wrote using it**: A gusty fart can be a deadly one.
7. **Impermanence** - the quality or state of being impermanent
    1. **The sentence I saw it in**: "Impermanence becomes vivid in the present moment; so do compassion and wonder and courage."
    2. **One new sentence I wrote using it**: I sometimes go into impermanence when I dissociate.
8. **Eloquently** -  vividly or movingly expressive or revealing
    1. **The sentence I saw it in**: "As one student so eloquently put it, 'Buddha nature, cleverly disguised as fear, kicks our ass into being receptive.'"
    2. **One new sentence I wrote using it**: I speak eloquently on subjects I am interested in.
9. **Nevertheless** - in spite of that, however
    1. **The sentence I saw it in**: "Sooner or later, we understand that although we can't make fear look pretty, it will nevertheless introduce us to all the teaching we've ever heard or read."
    2. **One new sentence I wrote using it**: Having imposter syndrome sucks; nevertheless, I push through it and do the best with what I've got.
