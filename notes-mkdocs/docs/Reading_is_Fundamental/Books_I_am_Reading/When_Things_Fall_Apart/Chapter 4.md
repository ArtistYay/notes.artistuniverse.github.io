### Notes
- When meditating, focus on your breath for 25% of the time and remain aware of your surroundings, but not to the point where it becomes a distraction.
- Breathing out and not focusing on anything specific is the chance to relax and let go.
- Going into overthinking is bound to happen; catching yourself and saying 'thinking' in your mind brings you back.
- Meditation is about opening and relaxing with whatever arises, without picking and choosing.
### Words I Learned While Reading
1. **Motes** - a small particle
	1. **The sentence I saw it in**: "In one song he says that mind has more projections than there are dust motes in a sunbeam and that even hundreds of spears couldn't put an end to that."
	2. **One new sentence I wrote using it**: Having a **mote** of hope that what I desire in life is enough motivation to keep myself moving forward.
2. **Solemn** - very serious or formal
	1. **The sentence I saw it in**: "So as meditators we might as well stop struggling against our thoughts and realize that honesty and humor are far more inspiring and helpful than any kind of **solemn** religious striving for or against anything."
	2. **One new sentence i wrote using it**: I take life to **solemn**, I need to learn to let it flow.
