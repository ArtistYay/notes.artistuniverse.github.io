I wanted to do something different in my life...let other people be nosey lol jk but I did want you guys to know what I've been up to. I know it's kinda the reason why this sub-domain exist but this is my first edition of 'Aye Yo Artist! What Link Piqued Your Interest!?' every week I will try to give you links which title was interesting enough to click on. Don't worry nothing malicious (I hope) and if so [Virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/url) is your friend, now let's hop into it.

- A paper written by Shaked Zychlinski which explains how malicious sites are turning up non malicious to AI agents. This has me thinking...how does an AI agent know when a website is legit or malicious ðŸ¤” especially when Perplexity AI gives you links.
	- [A Whole New World: Creating a Parallel-Poisoned Web Only AI-Agents Can See by Shaked Zychlinski](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00124)
- We all know 'Vibe Coding' is a pentester's dream but this blog from Melissa Miller explains if you don't know wtf your doing then don't do it.
	- [Vibe Coding: A Pentesterâ€™s Dream by Melissa Miller](https://www.netspi.com/blog/executive-blog/web-application-pentesting/vibe-coding-a-pentesters-dream/)
- Speaking of 'Vibe Coding' with AI Semgrep has written on how you can use Claude Code and OpenAI Codex agents to find vulnerabilities.
	- [Finding vulnerabilities in modern web apps using Claude Code and OpenAI Codex by Romain Gaucher, Vasilii Ermilov, and Clint Gibler](https://semgrep.dev/blog/2025/finding-vulnerabilities-in-modern-web-apps-using-claude-code-and-openai-codex/)
- Advanced Persistent Teenagers aren't the only problem companies have to be mindful of, apparently (which I get) it's cool to hack into your school for brownie points ðŸ˜Ž
	- [Kids in the UK are hacking their own schools for dares and notoriety by Ram Iyer](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/11/kids-in-the-uk-are-hacking-their-own-schools-for-dares-and-notoriety/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)
