### Authentication

This method is to confirm you are who you say you are. You can confirm by using a username and for more security purposes give a password to really say I am not an imposter. You can also use MFA which is another step to confirm your identity.

### Authorization 

When you have been authenticated by the local guard, said guard checks what you have access to. Said guard will walk you through the premises and guide you where you need to be.
