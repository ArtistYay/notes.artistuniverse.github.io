### Federation

Let's say you have users that are not apart of your organization but you want them to leverage your applications you have hosted in your environment (B2C). Let's also say your users don't want to make an account for every application they want to use, they want to user a Google account to log into any type of application with that same account. Well that's where federation comes in. 

It's a trust relationship between two or more domains. A collection of IdPs and SPs that agree to work together and trust each other to make that happen.

So what exactly is a trust relationship?

### Trust Relationship

This relationship is like a partnership. There are agreements and contract obligations between partners that builds the trust to have the federation.
