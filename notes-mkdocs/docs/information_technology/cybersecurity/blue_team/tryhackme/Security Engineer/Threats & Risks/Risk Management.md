### **I. NIST SP 800-30**

- **Developed by:** National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
- **Focus:** Provides a systematic approach to risk assessment, focusing on information systems and security.
- **Steps:**
    1. **Prepare for the assessment:** Define the scope, identify resources, and establish roles and responsibilities.
    2. **Conduct the assessment:**
        - Identify threat sources and events.
        - Identify vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions.
        - Determine the likelihood of occurrence.
        - Analyze the impact of potential events.
        - Determine risk as a combination of likelihood and impact.
    3. **Communicate results:** Document and share the findings with relevant stakeholders.
    4. **Maintain the assessment:** Regularly review and update the risk assessment.
- **Benefits:**
    - Comprehensive and widely recognized.
    - Provides a structured approach.
    - Aligns with other NIST security standards.
### **II. Facilitated Risk Analysis Process (FRAP)**

- **Focus:** A collaborative and inclusive approach to risk assessment, involving a group of stakeholders.
- **Key Elements:**
    - **Facilitator:** Leads the process and ensures effective participation.
    - **Stakeholders:** Individuals with diverse perspectives and knowledge about the system or process being assessed.
    - **Structured Discussions:** Guided discussions to identify and evaluate risks.
- **Benefits:**
    - Leverages diverse perspectives.
    - Encourages buy-in and ownership of the risk assessment.
    - Can lead to more comprehensive and accurate results.
### **III. Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE)**

- **Focus:** Identifying and prioritizing assets based on their criticality to the organization's mission and assessing the threats and vulnerabilities that could impact those assets.
- **Key Features:**
    - **Asset-centric:** Starts with identifying the most critical assets.
    - **Threat-driven:** Focuses on the threats that could affect those assets.
    - **Self-directed:** Organizations conduct the assessment themselves, with guidance from the OCTAVE methodology.
- **Benefits:**
    - Prioritizes risks based on business impact.
    - Encourages organizational ownership of the risk management process.
    - Suitable for organizations with limited resources.
### **IV. Failure Modes and Effect Analysis (FMEA)**

- **Focus:** Identifying potential failure modes for a system or process and analyzing their effects and likelihood of occurrence.
- **Steps:**
    1. **Identify potential failure modes.**
    2. **Analyze the effects of each failure mode.**
    3. **Determine the severity of each effect.**
    4. **Identify potential causes of each failure mode.**
    5. **Determine the likelihood of occurrence.**
    6. **Identify current controls.**
    7. **Calculate the Risk Priority Number (RPN).**
    8. **Develop and implement mitigation actions.**
- **Benefits:**
    - Proactive approach to risk management.
    - Focuses on preventing failures.
    - Widely used in engineering and manufacturing.
