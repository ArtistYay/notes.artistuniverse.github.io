### What is Burp Suite?

- Integrated platform for web application security testing.
- Tools for scanning, fuzzing, intercepting, and analyzing web traffic.
- Used by security professionals to find and exploit vulnerabilities.
### What is a Proxy Server?

- Gateway between users and the internet.
- Helps prevent cyberattacks on private networks.
- "Intermediary" between end-users and web pages.
### Burp Suite's Core Functionality:

- Captures and allows manipulation of HTTP/HTTPS traffic between browser and web server.
### Burp Community Edition Features:

- **Burp Proxy:** Intercept and modify requests/responses.
- **Repeater:** Capture, modify, and resend requests repeatedly. Useful for crafting payloads (SQLi) or testing endpoints.
- **Intruder:** Spray endpoints with requests. Used for brute-force or fuzzing.
- **Decoder:** Encode/decode data.
- **Comparer:** Compare two pieces of data (word or byte level).
- **Sequencer:** Assess randomness of tokens (session cookies, CSRF tokens).
### Burp Suite Options:

- **Global Settings:** Affect the entire Burp Suite installation.
- **Project Settings:** Specific to the current project (not saved in Community Edition).
### Burp Proxy:

- Intercepts requests and holds them back from the server.
- Requests appear in the Proxy tab for further action (forward, drop, edit, send to other modules).
- "Intercept is on" button toggles interception.
- Captures and logs requests even when interception is off.
- Captures and logs WebSocket communication.
- Captured requests viewable in HTTP history and WebSockets history.
- "Intercept responses based on the following rules" allows flexible response interception.
- "Match and Replace" uses regex to modify requests/responses (e.g., user agent, cookies).

### Site Map and Issue Definitions:

- **Site Map:** Tree structure of targeted web applications. Automatically generated by browsing with the proxy enabled. Useful for mapping APIs.
- **Issue Definitions:** Extensive list of web vulnerabilities with descriptions and references.
### Scope Settings:

- Controls the target scope.
- Includes/excludes domains/IPs.
- Focuses testing on specific web applications.
### Burp Suite Browser:

- May encounter sandbox errors when running as root (Linux).
- **Solutions:**
    1. Create a new user and run Burp Suite under a low-privilege account.
    2. Disable sandbox in `Settings -> Tools -> Burp's browser`. _Caution:_ Disabling the sandbox can be a security risk.
### Scoping and Targeting:

- Define what gets proxied and logged.
- `Target` tab -> right-click -> `Add To Scope`.
- Disable logging for out-of-scope traffic.
- In Proxy settings, "Intercept Client Requests" -> `And` `URL` `Is in target scope`.

### Proxying HTTPS:

- May encounter certificate errors with HTTPS sites.
- Solution: Add the PortSwigger CA certificate to the browser's trusted authorities.
