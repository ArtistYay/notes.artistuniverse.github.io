Gen AI applications are powered by large language models (LLMs), which are a specialized type of machine learning model that can use to perform natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including:

- Determining sentiment or otherwise classifying natural language text.

- Summarizing text.

- Comparing multiple text sources for semantic similarity.

- Generating new natural language.

large language models are based on the _transformer_ architecture, which builds on and extends some techniques that have been proven successful in modeling _vocabularies_ to support NLP tasks

Transformer model architecture consists of two components, or _blocks_:

- An _encoder_ block that creates semantic representations of the training vocabulary.

- A _decoder_ block that generates new language sequences.
